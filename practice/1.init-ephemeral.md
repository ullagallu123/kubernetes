You're absolutely right! Kubernetes Pods can have **init containers** and **ephemeral containers**, serving different purposes:

---

### **1. Init Containers**:
- **Purpose**:  
  Init containers run **before** the main application containers start. They are primarily used for setup tasks, like initializing configurations, waiting for dependencies, or running checks.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Run sequentially, one at a time.
  - Must complete successfully before the main containers start.
  - Can use different images/tools from the main container.
  - If one of the init execution failed the k8s retrys again and again the pod is in pending state 

**Example of a Pod with an Init Container**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-init-container
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app-container
      image: nginx:1.25.2
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  initContainers:
    - name: init-container
      image: busybox:1.35
      command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Initializing...; sleep 5;"]
```

kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <init-container-name>

### **2. Ephemeral Containers**:
- **Purpose**:  
  Ephemeral containers are used for **debugging running Pods**. Unlike init containers, they don't run during startup but can be added later to an already running Pod for troubleshooting purposes.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Temporary and not part of the original Pod spec.
  - Useful for tasks like inspecting application state or debugging without restarting the Pod.

**Adding an Ephemeral Container for Debugging**:
```bash
kubectl debug pod-with-init-container  --image=busybox:1.35 --target=app-container -- sh
```
This command:
- Creates an ephemeral container using the `busybox` image.
- Attaches it to the running Pod `pod-with-init-container`.
- Opens a shell session inside the ephemeral container for debugging.
