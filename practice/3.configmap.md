Sure! Here's an exercise that demonstrates how to use a **ConfigMap** to configure an application, consuming the configuration through **environment variables** and **command-line arguments**.

### **Exercise: Using ConfigMap in Kubernetes**

#### **Objective**:
1. Create a ConfigMap that stores key-value pairs for configuration.
2. Use the ConfigMap in a Pod by:
   - Injecting configuration as environment variables.
   - Passing configuration as command-line arguments to the container.

---

### **Steps**:

#### **Step 1: Create a ConfigMap**

Use the following YAML file to create a ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
  namespace: dev
data:
  APP_NAME: "MyApp"
  APP_PORT: "8080"
  APP_MODE: "production"
```

Apply the ConfigMap:
```bash
kubectl apply -f app-config.yaml
```

---

#### **Step 2: Create a Pod**

Create a Pod that uses the ConfigMap. Here, the configuration will be consumed as both **environment variables** and **command-line arguments**.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-example-pod
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
    - name: example-container
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c"]
      # Pass configuration as command-line args and environment variables
      args: ["echo APP_NAME is $APP_NAME; echo APP_PORT is $APP_PORT; echo APP_MODE is $APP_MODE; sleep 3600"]
      env:
        - name: APP_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: app-config
              key: APP_NAME
        - name: APP_PORT
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: app-config
              key: APP_PORT
        - name: APP_MODE
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: app-config
              key: APP_MODE
```

Apply the Pod:
```bash
kubectl apply -f configmap-example-pod.yaml
```

---

#### **Step 3: Verify the Configuration**

1. **Check Pod Logs**:  
   View the logs of the Pod to confirm that the ConfigMap values are being used correctly:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs configmap-example-pod -n dev
   ```
   Output should look like this:
   ```
   APP_NAME is MyApp
   APP_PORT is 8080
   APP_MODE is production
   ```

2. **Describe the Pod**:  
   Confirm the environment variables are set in the Pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod configmap-example-pod -n dev
   ```

---

#### **Step 4: Modify the ConfigMap**

Update the ConfigMap to change the values:
```bash
kubectl edit configmap app-config -n dev
```
For example, update:
```yaml
data:
  APP_NAME: "MyUpdatedApp"
  APP_PORT: "9090"
  APP_MODE: "development"
```

---

#### **Step 5: Test Updates**

Since the ConfigMap is not dynamically updated in running Pods, delete and recreate the Pod to see the updated values:
```bash
kubectl delete pod configmap-example-pod -n dev
kubectl apply -f configmap-example-pod.yaml
kubectl logs configmap-example-pod -n dev
```

---

### **Bonus Task**:
1. Try mounting the ConfigMap as a **volume** and reading its values from a file.  
2. Use the ConfigMap in a **Deployment** and test rolling updates when the configuration changes.
